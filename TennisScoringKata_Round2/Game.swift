//In this iteration, I want to have a class/struct that converts points to "game states". Last iteration, things got confusing because I tried mapping points directly to strings, but that doesnt work/gets difficult when we get into Deuce, adv, and game scenarios
//A single game of tennis can be interpreted as a state machine. States include: Pre-Deuce (anything that includes scores other than Deuce, Game, Or Advantage states), Game, Deuce, Adv. server, Adv. receiver, Game server, Game Receiver
//I want this class to take two Ints, and figure out what the state of the game is. Based on the game state, we can print out a user facing string to tell us what the score is. 
//Pre-Deuce is the trickiest state because it encompasses many combinations of points. the logic for that state is: (score1 <= 3 || score2 <= 3) && (score1 != 3 && score2 != 3)
//When in the Pre-Deuce state, we can map 0,1,2,3 points to strings and print out the score using those strings. Anything other than the pre-deuce state has a fixed user-facing string which makes those cases easy
